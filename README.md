#BeamBot Repository

This is my repository for my beambot project, a Beam.pro chat bot. I need a better name than beambot or pybot, but those are what I'm working with currently.

##Setup

Python 3 is required. I develop using Python 3.4 on Ubuntu 14.04/Ubuntu 15.04, other distros and OSes have not been tested.

####Required libraries:

* `websockets`: You can install this via `sudo pip3 install websockets` on Ubuntu.
* If you are developing on anything less than Python 3.4, you will need to install the `asyncio` library. This can be done via `sudo pip3 install asyncio`.

Once the proper libaries are installed, you need to edit the `config.py.template` file with your Beam.pro information and the chat ID you want and rename it to `config.py`. 

Then, just run `python3 beambot.py`!
